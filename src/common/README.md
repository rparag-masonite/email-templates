# Common Templates

This directory contains the templates that are common to all of the companies in the `companies` array in the `gulpfile.js`.

### Adding a new common template

To add a new common template, simply create a new MJML file and add it to this directory. During the build process, it will be copied over to each company's folder and be used alongside it's specific styles and images.
